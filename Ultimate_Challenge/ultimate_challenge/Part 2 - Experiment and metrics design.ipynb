    "1. if No new features were to be added to the dataset once this experiment has commenced, I would have to say that the an increase of the weekday percentage of trips in Gotham and Metropolis would be the key measure. This is because, as per the information statement, the cities are equally active on weekends and by seeing a general increase of weekday_pct in these two cities would mean that the emotion of the drivers to take these trips would have increased. Again this is assuming that no new features would be added. The best feature would be to track how many weekday trips from one city to the next had taken place during the experiment vs. before the experiment. But as far as I can tell this information is not available with our current dataset.\n",
    "2. a. Again, assuming we could not add gather any new types of data(i.e, amount of trips betweeen cities, we would first freeze our dataset as is right before the experiment takes place. This would give us our numbers before the experiment begins. After an ample amount of time we will take another freeze of our data and first, elimanate all users that have a last trip date before our experiment began as well as eliminate all users that do not have Gotham or Metropolis listed as their main cities. Then we can compare the weekday percentage from before the experiment to after the experiment and see if there is any statistical significance between the two.\n",
    "\n",
    "b. to initialize, it would be easiest to simply look at the mean between the two datasets. If the post-experiment mean weekday percentage is higher, than we at the very least say that as of beginning the experiemnt the mean weekday pct as increased. if it decreases or stays the same, then we can very safely say that this new experiment yielded no changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "c. We could interpret the results as a guide for further value provided by the company. By looking for roadblocks put into place by city ordinances, like tolls, and addressing them, we could expect to see higher frequencies of transactions with the companies added value to customers. If there was no such changes, we may reccomend to the city operations team that looking to provide multi-city travel options are not worth the effort until a new experiment is tested."
