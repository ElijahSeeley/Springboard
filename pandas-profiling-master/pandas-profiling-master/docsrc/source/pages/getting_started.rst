Getting started

Getting started
Start by loading in your pandas DataFrame, e.g. by using

.. code-block:: python

        import numpy as np
        import pandas as pd
        from pandas_profiling import ProfileReport

        df = pd.DataFrame(
            np.random.rand(100, 5),
            columns=['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e']
        )

To generate the report, run:

.. code-block:: python

        profile = ProfileReport(df, title='Pandas Profiling Report')

--------------

You can configure the profile report in any way you like. The example code below loads the `explorative configuration file <https://github.com/pandas-profiling/pandas-profiling/blob/master/src/pandas_profiling/config_explorative.yaml>`_, that includes many features for text (length distribution, unicode information), files (file size, creation time) and images (dimensions, exif information). If you are interested what exact settings were used, you can compare with the `default configuration file <https://github.com/pandas-profiling/pandas-profiling/blob/master/src/pandas_profiling/config_default.yaml>`_.

.. code-block:: python

        profile = ProfileReport(df, title='Pandas Profiling Report', explorative=True)


Learn more about configuring ``pandas-profiling`` on the :doc:`advanced_usage` page.

Jupyter notebook
----------------

We recommend generating reports interactively by using the Jupyter notebook. There are two interfaces (see animations below): through widgets and through a HTML report.

.. image:: ../_static/widgets.gif

This is achieved by simply displaying the report. In the Jupyter Notebook, run:

.. code-block:: python

  profile.to_widgets()

The HTML report can be included in a Jupyter notebook:

.. image:: ../_static/iframe.gif

Run the following code:

.. code-block:: python

  profile.to_notebook_iframe()


Saving the report
-----------------
If you want to generate a HTML report file, save the ``ProfileReport`` to an object and use the ``to_file()`` function:

.. code-block:: python

        profile.to_file("your_report.html")

Alternatively, you can obtain the data as json:

.. code-block:: python

        # As a string
        json_data = profile.to_json()

        # As a file
        profile.to_file("your_report.json")



Command line usage
------------------
For standard formatted CSV files that can be read immediately by pandas, you can use the pandas_profiling executable. Run

.. code-block:: bash

        pandas_profiling -h

for information about options and arguments.
