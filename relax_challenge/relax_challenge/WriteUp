Hello, Git is giving me a lot of issues with pushing since I moved. So I have put my writeup in plain text here. - Also, the most recent Relax Notebook is not up to date, it is missing a few lines. 

Looking at the data, I believe that most of my research did not pan out as I had planned. I had attempted multiple models and graphs of various sorts, but they were a bit fruitless. After dividing the adopted and unadopted customers, they mainly seem very similar in scope and don't seem to pose much difference between each other from what I was able to find. However there are certain trends that the company can look into. The time of year at sign up has as bit of an impact on the users likelihood. It seems that users created later in the year are less likely to adopt than earlier. This may have to do with certain marketing campaigns, but from the outside there isn't too much more for me to break down. I see a small correlation between organization ID and the adoptability, likely because certain organization probably rely on a few employees to use Relax's services more often than others. So it's likely that particular positions of these certain organizations use the Relax service much more than others which is why they are considered adopted, while others may only have to log in at sparse intervals. Aside from this, I was rather unsuccessful in determing any exact causes, and my model was also rather imprecise in determining adoption factors.
